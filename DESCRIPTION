Title: A package to run a quick ML benchmark on a binary classification task
Version: 0.4.1
Author: Arash A. Amini
Maintainer: The package maintainer <aaamini@ucla.edu>
Description: The package allows one to quickly run a couple of most common binary classification algorithms on a new problem to get at idea of the limits of performance. It makes some guesses about the values of the hyper-parameters (mostly the default values!) and avoids hyper-parameter tuning in favor of performance. 
    The package should handle factor variables, and in later editions basic imputation of missing values. 
    The package is under development.
